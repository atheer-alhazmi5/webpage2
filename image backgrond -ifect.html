<p><span>The Internet has become an important part of our lives and has a direct impact on social, cultural and scientific life.</span>
 Developed countries are putting the Internet on their first priority. Countries that do not have the potential to connect 
 the Internet are lagging behind especially as the Internet is also used for military purposes, the system of armies, exercises,
 and even in the systems of espionage on the States and their armies, and contributes to the rapid transmission of information, 
 and accessibility, through e-mail systems, and video and audio communication.The most things that have changed by the existence 
 of the Internet is the cultural scene of the world. Literary and religious ideas and the moral system can be easily and quickly disseminated.
It has become possible to influence a large segment of the world, although some of the ideas that are spreading may never be useful or incite violence, hatred and moral disintegration.
 This is one of the disadvantages of the Internet, which fights all states to reduce it,</p>
